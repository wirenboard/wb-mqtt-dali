Guidance for Claude Code in this repo.

## Project Overview

`wb-mqtt-dali` is a Python asyncio MQTT-DALI bridge for Wiren Board hardware. Connects DALI devices to an MQTT broker for control via MQTT topics and JSON-RPC.

## Environment Setup

Use Python 3.9 — same as CI (Debian bullseye). Newer interpreters mask bugs that only hit on 3.9.

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh   # install uv if missing
uv python install 3.9
uv venv --python 3.9 .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Always use tools from `.venv/bin/...`.

## Mandatory Verification Pipeline (after any code change)

```bash
.venv/bin/isort --profile black wb/ tests/ e2e/ bin/wb-mqtt-dali
.venv/bin/black wb/ tests/ e2e/ bin/wb-mqtt-dali
.venv/bin/pylint --rcfile=pyproject.toml wb/ tests/ e2e/ bin/wb-mqtt-dali
.venv/bin/pytest
```

## Agent Workflow Rules

- Never create a git commit without explicit user approval in the current conversation.
- Never modify existing tests without explicit user approval.
- Do not rename existing identifiers (locals, params, functions, methods, classes, module-level constants) unless functionally required (old name became misleading after a behavior change, or a real name clash). Subjective "consistency"/"better naming" doesn't count. Expanding a signature does not justify renaming.
- Do not introduce temporary local variables for 1–2 uses; only if used 3+ times or they materially improve readability.
- Do not disable/skip tests; do not add `# pylint: disable` / `# noqa` / `# type: ignore` without a concrete reason. Fix the underlying issue.
- Never force-push (`--force` / `--force-with-lease`) to update a PR. Add new commits — reviewers need incremental changes.
- Tests must not **add new** access to private attributes (`_underscore`) of production classes. If a test can't be written against the public API, **stop and ask the user** — the fix usually requires widening the API or rethinking the test. Pre-existing private access in untouched test code is tolerated debt.
- `# pylint: disable=protected-access` must scope to a single function or line, never a whole module.

## Task Workflow

Non-trivial changes follow plan → implement → review, with artifacts in `doc/`:

- **Plan** — `doc/<topic>_plan.md`. Written before implementation; intended approach and scope.
- **Review** — `doc/<topic>_review.md`. Written after implementation by the code-reviewer agent; findings against plan and diff.

`<topic>` is a short snake_case slug. Agents that take a plan/review as input read the matching file from `doc/` first.

## Architecture

Bridges DALI buses to MQTT. Each bus runs as an independent `ApplicationController`.

```
MQTT Broker  (user topics + RPC)
      ↕
MQTTDispatcher
      ↓
ApplicationController  (per bus, state machine)
  ↙            ↘
Commissioning   DevicePublisher
(discovery)     (MQTT publishing)
      ↓
DaliDevice / Dali2Device
      ↓
WBDALIDriver
      ↕   (MQTT RPC + topics on the same broker)
wb-mqtt-serial
      ↕
Physical DALI Bus (Modbus)
```

### Key Modules

- **`gateway.py`** — `WbDaliGateway`: manages buses, creates one `ApplicationController` per bus via `bus_from_json()`.
- **`application_controller.py`** — Per-bus state machine: `UNINITIALIZED → INITIALIZING → READY ↔ COMMISSIONING / IN_QUIESCENT_MODE`. Polling loop, state sync, RPC delegation.
- **`commissioning.py`** — Device discovery via binary search (`BinarySearchAddressFinder`). Produces `CommissioningResult` (new/missing/changed).
- **`wbdali.py`** — WB-DALI driver: command queuing and transport to `wb-mqtt-serial` via MQTT RPC + reply topics (no direct bus I/O).
- **`device_publisher.py`** — Publishes state to MQTT; runs the polling loop.
- **`mqtt_dispatcher.py`** — Routes incoming MQTT messages to handlers.
- **`mqtt_rpc_server.py`** — JSON-RPC over MQTT (commissioning, device control).
- **`common_dali_device.py` / `dali_device.py` / `dali2_device.py`** — Device models. `CommonDaliDevice` is the base; `Dali2Device` adds DALI 2 extended features.
- **`settings.py`** — Config parsed from `/etc/wb-mqtt-dali.conf`, validated against `wb-mqtt-dali.schema.json`.

### Device Types & Compat

- Parameter modules named `dali_type{N}_parameters.py` (50+ types). Type 8 (color control) has sub-modules: xy, TC, RGBWAF, primary-N. `gear/` holds feature modules (switching, dimming curve, thermal protection, demand response).
- `dali_compat.py` / `dali2_compat.py` wrap upstream `python-dali` (Wiren Board fork) to normalize DALI vs DALI 2 command APIs.

## Code Style & Notes

- Style/lint config: `pyproject.toml` (baseline: `https://github.com/wirenboard/codestyle/blob/master/python/config/pyproject.toml`).
- All I/O is `asyncio`; tests use `unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase`.
